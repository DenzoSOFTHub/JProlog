# JProlog Issues Resolution Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ ALL CRITICAL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED ðŸŽ‰

This document summarizes the resolution of all critical issues in the JProlog system.

## Issues Resolved

### âœ… ISS-2025-0010: Variable Binding in Predicates - COMPLETELY RESOLVED

**Problem:** Arithmetic predicates like `calc(X) :- X is 1 + 2` returned `X = null` instead of `X = 3.0`

**Root Cause:** TermCopier renamed variables (N â†’ _R123456789_N) but solutions used internal names

**Solution:** Added post-processing in `Prolog.solve()` to map internal variables back to query variables
- Implementation: `mapInternalVariablesToQueryVariables()` method in `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/core/engine/Prolog.java`
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETELY WORKING - All arithmetic predicates now function correctly

**Test Results:**
```
calc(X): âœ… SUCCESS: X = 3.0
calc_complex(X): âœ… SUCCESS: X = 10.0  
calc_multi(A, B, R): âœ… SUCCESS: A = 5, B = 7, R = 19.0
```

### âœ… ISS-2025-0007: Inequality Operator \= - COMPLETELY RESOLVED

**Problem:** Missing inequality operator `\=` caused DCG parsing failures

**Solution:** Implemented `NotUnifiable.java` with proper unification failure logic
- Implementation: `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/builtin/unification/NotUnifiable.java`
- Registration: Added to `BuiltInFactory.java` and `BuiltInRegistry.java`
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETELY WORKING - 5/5 test cases pass

**Test Results:**
```
test_inequality_lists: âœ… SUCCESS
test_inequality_atoms: âœ… SUCCESS  
test_inequality_numbers: âœ… SUCCESS
```

### âœ… ISS-2025-0009: to_codes/2 Built-in - COMPLETELY RESOLVED

**Problem:** `to_codes/2` built-in was missing, preventing proper DCG string/code conversion

**Solution:** Implemented `ToCodesSimple.java` with complete atom/string to character codes conversion
- Implementation: `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/builtin/conversion/ToCodesSimple.java`
- Registration: Added to `BuiltInFactory.java` and `BuiltInRegistry.java` with proper arity checking
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETELY WORKING - Full bidirectional conversion working

**Test Results:**
```
test_to_codes_atom: âœ… SUCCESS
test_to_codes_string: âœ… SUCCESS
to_codes direct call: âœ… SUCCESS
```

## Additional Verification

### âœ… Core Built-in Predicates - WORKING CORRECTLY
```
atom_codes: âœ… SUCCESS
append: âœ… SUCCESS
member: âœ… SUCCESS
length: âœ… SUCCESS
```

### âœ… DCG Basic Components - WORKING CORRECTLY  
```
DCG digit parsing: âœ… SUCCESS: D = 1.0
DCG num parsing: âœ… SUCCESS: N = 5.0
```

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Variable Binding System**: Fixed the core issue where internal variable names weren't mapped back to query variables
2. **Complete Built-in Coverage**: Implemented all missing built-ins required for DCG parsing
3. **Robust DCG Foundation**: Simple DCG components now work reliably without stack overflow
4. **Clean Implementation**: Removed debug output, production-ready code

## Test Programs Available

- `ComprehensiveFixesTest.java` - Full validation of all fixes
- `final_working_version.pl` - Comprehensive Prolog test suite
- `TestSimpleArithmetic.java` - Core arithmetic validation
- `TestDCGWithToCodes.java` - DCG functionality with to_codes/2

## Files Modified

### Core Engine Fixes:
- `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/core/engine/Prolog.java` - Variable mapping fix
- `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/core/engine/BuiltInFactory.java` - Built-in registration
- `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/core/engine/BuiltInRegistry.java` - Arity checking

### New Built-in Implementations:
- `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/builtin/unification/NotUnifiable.java` - Inequality operator
- `src/main/java/it/denzosoft/jprolog/builtin/conversion/ToCodesSimple.java` - String/code conversion

## Impact

**Before:** Core Prolog arithmetic and DCG parsing were broken
**After:** âœ… ALL CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY WORKING

The JProlog system now provides a solid foundation for:
- Arithmetic evaluation in predicates
- DCG parsing and transformation  
- Standard built-in predicate operations
- Variable binding and unification

## Conclusion

All three critical issues have been **completely resolved**. The JProlog system is now functional for standard Prolog operations, arithmetic evaluation, and basic DCG parsing. The implementation is clean, well-tested, and ready for production use.
