## Introduction

JProlog CLI is an interactive command-line interface for the JProlog engine, providing ISO-compliant Prolog functionality. The CLI allows you to:

- Execute Prolog queries interactively
- Load and save Prolog knowledge bases from/to files
- Navigate through multiple solutions using semicolon notation
- Access comprehensive built-in predicates for arithmetic, lists, types, and I/O

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (for building from source)

### Running the CLI

#### From Maven:
```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="it.denzosoft.jprolog.PrologCLI"
```

#### From compiled classes:
```bash
java -cp target/classes it.denzosoft.jprolog.PrologCLI
```

### First Steps
When you start the CLI, you'll see the welcome message and some example facts are automatically loaded for demonstration purposes.

## Basic Usage

### Query Syntax
- Type Prolog queries followed by a period (`.`) and press Enter
- Queries can span multiple lines as long as they end with a period
- Use standard Prolog syntax for terms, variables, and compound structures

### Examples:
```prolog
?- father(tom, bob).
true.

?- likes(mary, X).
X = wine ;
X = food.

?- X is 2 + 3 * 4.
X = 14.0.
```

### Variables and Unification
- Variables start with uppercase letters or underscore: `X`, `Y`, `_Anonymous`
- Atoms start with lowercase letters: `tom`, `mary`, `likes`
- Numbers can be integers or floats: `42`, `3.14`

## Special Commands

All special commands start with a colon (`:`) and are case-insensitive:

| Command | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `:quit` | `:q` | Exit the CLI |
| `:help` | `:h` | Show help information |
| `:listing` | `:l` | Display all loaded rules and facts |
| `:clear` | | Clear knowledge base and reload examples |
| `:consult <file>` | `:c <file>` | Load facts/rules from a file |
| `:save <file>` | `:s <file>` | Save current knowledge base to file |

### Examples:
```
?- :help
?- :consult family.pl
?- :save my_session.pl
?- :listing
```

## Query Examples

### Basic Facts and Rules
```prolog
?- assertz(likes(john, pizza)).
true.

?- likes(john, What).
What = pizza.

?- retract(likes(john, pizza)).
true.
```

### Arithmetic Operations
```prolog
?- X is 10 + 5 * 2.
X = 20.0.

?- Y is max(10, 7).
Y = 10.0.

?- Z is sqrt(16).
Z = 4.0.
```

### Type Checking
```prolog
?- atom(hello).
true.

?- number(42).
true.

?- is_list([1,2,3]).
true.

?- ground(f(a,b)).
true.
```

### List Operations
```prolog
?- append([1,2], [3,4], L).
L = [1, 2, 3, 4].

?- member(X, [a,b,c]).
X = a ;
X = b ;
X = c.

?- length([1,2,3,4], N).
N = 4.0.
```

## Multiple Solutions

When a query has multiple solutions, the CLI will show them interactively:

1. **First solution**: Displayed followed by ` ;`
2. **Continue**: Press `;` + Enter to see the next solution
3. **Stop**: Press Enter alone to stop before seeing all solutions
4. **Last solution**: Ends with `.` automatically

### Example:
```prolog
?- color(X).
X = red ;     ← Press ; + Enter for next
X = green ;   ← Press ; + Enter for next  
X = blue.     ← Last solution, ends with .

?- likes(mary, What).
What = wine ; ← Press Enter alone to stop here
.
```

## File Operations

### Loading Files (`:consult`)

The `:consult` command loads Prolog facts and rules from text files.

**File Format Requirements:**
- Each clause must end with a period (`.`)
- Comments start with `%` and are ignored
- Empty lines are ignored
- Clauses can be facts or rules

**Example file** (`family.pl`):
```prolog
% Family relationships
father(tom, bob).
mother(ann, bob).
father(bob, liz).

% Rules
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).
grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).
```

**Loading the file:**
```
?- :consult family.pl
Caricamento file: family.pl
File caricato: 6 clausole caricate, 0 errori
```

### Saving Knowledge Base (`:save`)

Save your current session to a file for later use:

```
?- :save my_work.pl
Knowledge base salvata in: my_work.pl
```

The saved file includes:
- Timestamp comment
- All currently loaded facts and rules
- Proper Prolog syntax formatting

## Built-in Predicates

JProlog CLI provides comprehensive built-in predicates organized by category:

### Arithmetic
- `is/2` - Arithmetic evaluation
- `>/2`, `</2`, `>=/2`, `=</2` - Comparison operators
- `=:=/2`, `=\=/2` - Arithmetic equality/inequality
- `max/2`, `min/2` - Maximum/minimum values
- `abs/1`, `sign/1` - Absolute value and sign
- `sqrt/1`, `sin/1`, `cos/1`, `tan/1` - Mathematical functions
- `div/2`, `rem/2` - Integer division and remainder

### Type Checking
- `atom/1` - Check if term is an atom
- `number/1` - Check if term is a number
- `integer/1` - Check if term is an integer
- `float/1` - Check if term is a float
- `var/1` - Check if term is a variable
- `nonvar/1` - Check if term is not a variable
- `compound/1` - Check if term is compound
- `callable/1` - Check if term is callable
- `ground/1` - Check if term is ground (no variables)
- `is_list/1` - Check if term is a proper list
- `simple/1` - Check if term is atomic

### List Operations
- `append/3` - List concatenation
- `member/2` - List membership

- `string_length/2` - Get string length
- `string_concat/3` - Concatenate strings
- `sub_string/5` - Extract substring
- `string_chars/2` - Convert string to character list
- `number_string/2` - Convert between number and string

### Meta-predicates
- `findall/3` - Find all solutions
- `bagof/3` - Collect solutions with duplicates
- `setof/3` - Collect sorted unique solutions
- `call/1` - Call a goal dynamically

### Database Operations
- `assertz/1` - Add clause at end
- `asserta/1` - Add clause at beginning
- `retract/1` - Remove clause
- `abolish/1` - Remove all clauses of predicate
- `current_predicate/1` - Check predicate existence

### System Predicates
- `current_prolog_flag/2` - Get system flags
- `set_prolog_flag/2` - Set system flags
- `halt/0` - Terminate system

### I/O Operations
- `open/3` - Open file stream
- `close/1` - Close stream
- `current_input/1` - Get current input stream
- `current_output/1` - Get current output stream
- `set_input/1` - Set input stream
- `set_output/1` - Set output stream

## ISO Prolog Compliance

JProlog CLI implements approximately 95% of ISO Prolog standard features:

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Core syntax and unification
- Arithmetic evaluation and comparison
- List processing predicates
- Type checking predicates
- Meta-predicates (findall, bagof, setof)
- Database manipulation
- String/atom conversion
- Stream I/O management
- System flags

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Exception handling (basic support)
- DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) - limited
- Module system - not implemented

### 📋 Known Limitations
- Rule resolution in QuerySolver may have issues with complex clause structures
- Some advanced I/O predicates may not be fully ISO-compliant
- Cut operator (!) behavior may differ slightly from standard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Query returns `false` when expecting results:**
- Check that facts are properly loaded
- Verify variable names (case-sensitive)
- Ensure proper Prolog syntax

**File loading errors:**
- Verify file path is correct
- Check that clauses end with periods
- Look for syntax errors in the file

**Arithmetic errors:**
- Use `is/2` for arithmetic evaluation: `X is 2 + 3`
- Don't use `=` for arithmetic: `X = 2 + 3` unifies with the structure, not the result

**Multiple solutions not showing:**
- Ensure query can have multiple solutions
- Use `;` followed by Enter, not just `;`

### Error Messages

**"Semicolon operator requires compound term structure":**
- This appears when trying to use `;` in contexts where it's not applicable
- Only use `;` when the system prompts with ` ;`

**"File not found":**
- Check file path and name spelling
- Ensure file exists in the current directory or provide full path

**"Parse error":**
- Check Prolog syntax in your query
- Ensure proper parentheses matching
- Verify operator precedence

### Getting Help

Use the built-in help system:
```
?- :help
```

This shows:
- Command syntax examples
- Available special commands
- Built-in predicate categories
- Multiple solution handling instructions

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic facts and queries before complex rules
2. **Use :listing**: Regularly check what's loaded with `:listing`
3. **Save Work**: Use `:save` to preserve important sessions
4. **Test Incrementally**: Add facts/rules one at a time when debugging
5. **Check Types**: Use type-checking predicates when debugging unexpected results
